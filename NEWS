In addition to many bug fixes, RTcmix version 3.0 adds a major feature:
the ability to route signals between instruments and to multiple outputs.
You set up the bus routing for each instrument using a new Minc call,
bus_config. See "docs/README.bus_config" for explanation.

A new instrument, MIXN, takes full advantage of the multiple-output
capability.

Instrument designers should see "docs/README.inst_porting" to find out
how to make your instruments compatible with this version of RTcmix.
