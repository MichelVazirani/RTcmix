RTcmix version 3.1
------------------

RTcmix version 3.1 adds bug fixes, new features, new instruments,
and support for Mac OS X.  (See ChangeLog.)  One new feature --
the pgen Minc call and friends -- is still somewhat experimental.
See docs in insts.vccm for info on using this.  This does not
yet work in OS X.


RTcmix version 3.0
------------------

In addition to many bug fixes, RTcmix version 3.0 adds a major feature:
the ability to route signals between instruments and to multiple outputs.
You set up the bus routing for each instrument using a new Minc call,
bus_config. See "docs/README.bus_config" for explanation.

A new instrument, MIXN, takes full advantage of the multiple-output
capability.

Instrument designers should see "docs/README.inst_porting" to find out
how to make your instruments compatible with this version of RTcmix.

Later 3.0 versions add support for alternative parsers: Perl and Python.
