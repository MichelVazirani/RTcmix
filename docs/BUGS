load errors
-----------

When using a standalone instrument (eg., FMINST vs. CMIX) compiled via make
standalone_inst, you will see a warning message about the load directive in
a scorefile.  Don't worry, be happy.

gen2 is flakey. E.g....

makegen(2,2,4,0)
9.05 9.07 9.10 9.11 

If there's a space after "9.11", the job will bail with 
"fsize: You haven't allocated function 3 yet!" No space after: no problem.

problem in MIX (and no doubt any other processing inst)...
I want to take a stereo file and extract one channel into a mono file.
My score:
   rtsetparams(44100, 1)
   rtinput("stereofile"); rtoutput("monofile")
   MIX(0,0,DUR(),1, 0)
Segfaults at end. The reason: <in> float buffer new'd in MIX ctor
is sized as MAXBUF, which uses rtsetparams chan arg (1 in this case),
NOT inputchans (2 in this case) inst member. So <in> is overwritten.

Problem with Irix MIPSPro compiler declaring float arrays on the stack,
if sized by a variable instead of a constant. This was happening in all
insts that take input from a buffer. Solution was to dynamically allocate
the insts' private input buffer on construction of the inst. But this
really chews up memory fast for some scores, so it's not the way to go.
