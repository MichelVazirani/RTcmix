load errors
-----------

When using a standalone instrument (eg., FMINST vs. CMIX) compiled via make
standalone_inst, you will see a warning message about the load directive in
a scorefile.  Don't worry, be happy.

------------

gen2 is flakey. E.g....

makegen(2,2,4,0)
9.05 9.07 9.10 9.11 

If there's a space after "9.11", the job will bail with 
"fsize: You haven't allocated function 3 yet!" No space after: no problem.
