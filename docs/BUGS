load errors
-----------

When using a standalone instrument (eg., FMINST vs. CMIX) compiled via make
standalone_inst, you will see a warning message about the load directive in
a scorefile.  Don't worry, be happy.

gen2 is flakey. E.g....

makegen(2,2,4,0)
9.05 9.07 9.10 9.11 

If there's a space after "9.11", the job will bail with 
"fsize: You haven't allocated function 3 yet!" No space after: no problem.

problem in MIX (and no doubt any other processing inst)...
I want to take a stereo file and extract one channel into a mono file.
My score:
   rtsetparams(44100, 1)
   rtinput("stereofile"); rtoutput("monofile")
   MIX(0,0,DUR(),1, 0)
Segfaults at end. The reason: <in> float buffer new'd in MIX ctor
is sized as MAXBUF, which uses rtsetparams chan arg (1 in this case),
NOT inputchans (2 in this case) inst member. So <in> is overwritten.
