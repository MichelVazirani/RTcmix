=head1 NAME

spray_init - initialize a random integer spray can

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<spray_init>(I<spray_table_number>, I<spray_table_size>, I<random_seed>)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Call B<spray_init> from a script to set up a random integer spray can.
The idea is that you create a table of integers and then use
L<get_spray|get_spray> to retrieve them one after the other.  The
table contains integers from zero to one less than the table size.
(Another way to look at this is that the table values are the randomly
scrambled table indices.)  Repeatedly calling L<get_spray|get_spray>
reads the table from left to right, so that no number appears twice
before all the other numbers have appeared once.

=over 8

=item I<spray_table_number>

The numeric ID for the spray table.  Note that these are distinct
from the tables you create with makegen.  You can have as many as
32 tables, numbered from 0 to 31.

=item I<spray_table_size>

The table can have as many as 512 values.

=item I<random_seed>

An integer to seed the random number generator.  Note that this
re-seeds the same random number generator used by L<rand|rand>,
L<random|random>, L<irand|irand>, etc.

See L<get_spray|get_spray> for an example.
