Performance
-----------

 - Measure performance relative to Minc.

   If it's really bad, some possible ways to improve it:

      1) Don't register all the function names for insts that
         aren't even compiled.  What this really means is either
         hand-editing the funclist or getting rid of the disk-based
         cmix inst dirs in insts.std that have equivalent RT versions.

      2) Make a scheme that registers RTcmix functions in two classes:
         those that expect to receive strings, and those that don't.
         The former could use the existing glue function.  The latter
         (the vast majority of insts) could use a simpler glue function
         that doesn't test each arg to find out if it's a string.
         Unfortunately, this requires a config file in each inst
         dir listing the insts and what they expect.

   After running a few informal tests, it doesn't look like there's
   a significant performance hit anyway!  Let me know if you find
   otherwise.

 - A way of registering RTcmix function names that aren't part of 
   the installation tree, i.e., user functions?
