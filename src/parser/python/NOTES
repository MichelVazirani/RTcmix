-  Namespace clashes with Python builtin functions:

      abs
      input
      max
      open
      pow
      round

   The cmix ones seem to have priority (because they were loaded
   most recently?).
  
- The ability to kill the job and still see peak stats doesn't work,
  though it does work in PCMIX.  Python is nuking our signal handler
  (sigint_handler in main.C) somehow?  Strange, because supposedly
  the interpreter is destroyed before we start playing score, by
  parse_score in Minc/parse_with_python.c.  The comments in parse_score
  imply that this used to work with Python 1.x.
