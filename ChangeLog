**** Released RTcmix-3.0.1 ****

NOTE: If you're running 3.0.0 now, you *really* want this update, due
to the fix Dave describes just below. There have been no changes to
instruments, so you can still use the 3.0.0 ones.   -JG

Thursday, June 8, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fixes to main.C and sockit.C supplied by Doug Scott. These affect
     compilation on Linux Mandrake (and probably other distros), as
     well as Irix 6.5.
   * Some other minor changes to encourage compilation on Irix 6.5.

Thursday, June 8, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Fixed Iptr deletion conditions in intraverse()
     memory overhead should be MUCH less now


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.0 ****

Saturday, May 27, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Added new instrument, REVMIX, by Ivica Bukvic, to insts.std.
   * Revive the sndreverse program.
   * Input from files now ignores in-bus count entirely.
   * New function table assigns for FMINST and WAVESHAPE (see
     docs/README.table_assigns). This makes old scores incompatible!
   * New sample scores showing bus_config feature.

Thursday, May 25, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New files: NEWS and docs/README.bus_config

Tuesday, May 16, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Many changes to ANSI-fy some older code and to enable more
     productive use of -Wall when compiling.
   * New message functions advise(), warn() and die() for use
     by instruments and others.
   * Add README.inst_porting and an instrument sample code dir.
   * Fix compilation problem involving pthreads that triggered
     errors on Irix 6.5 (and warnings on Irix 6.3).
     (main.C, intraverse.C)

Friday, May 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Get rid of MAXBUF -- no longer necessary or even useful.

Wednesday, May 10, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Changed bus_config schema to provide default behavior
     to maintain backwards compatibility with pre-bus_config scores

Sunday, May 7, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Update RT insts to 3.0 API (for bus_config, etc.).
   * Allocate input buffer dynamically in all RT insts that need one.
     (This is because MIPSPro compiler can't size an automatic array
     by a variable -- that's a GNU extension.) Allocate in run method
     to avoid gobbling up all memory when insts init before playing.

[Versions after 2.2.3 have new bus architecture, for instrument
 chaining and better use of multi-chan cards.]


**** Released RTcmix-2.2.3 ****

Thursday, May 4, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Reduce memory overhead of these instruments:
        COMBIT, DELAY, INPUTSIG, MIX, TRANS, STEREO, ELL, FILTSWEEP,
        FLANGE, TRANS and JDELAY.
     (Worth upgrading for this, since it was possible to exhaust
     virtual memory if a script had many, many notes -- all grabbing
     private buffers at the start, before playing.)
   * When reading off the end of a Minc array with get_array,
     return the last array element instead of zero.
     (minc_functions.c)

Monday, April 24, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * If set_option("audio_off") precedes call to rtsetparams,
     then audio output port not opened, and user can run multiple
     jobs (writing to disk).

Saturday, April 22, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New instrument: stgran (Mara Helmuth)
   * Add prototypes for sound.c and minout.c functions to ugens.h
   * Various cleanups in sound.c
   * Add minout.c (from various disk-based insts) to sys dir
     (and remove from gravy and sgran)

**** Released RTcmix-2.2.2 ****

Friday, April 21, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New instruments in insts.jg: COMPLIMIT and JGRAN

Thursday, April 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Changed the sample WAVETABLE scores to use new function
     table assignments.
   * Merged the INSTALL files into a top-level INSTALL file.
   * New PLACE instrument - just like disk-based place, but 
     using RT mechanism for faster file i/o.

Friday, March 31, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fixed bug in rtinput.c: sometimes got initial offset wrong in
     fairly obscure circumstances. (rtinput.c)
   * Added dBFS peak and location in seconds to peak stats report.
     (rtwritesamps.C)

Saturday, March 26, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Show peak stats, and close output file, even when killing with
     control-C. (main.C)
   * Added dbamp function for lib and Minc.
     (ampdb.c, minc_functions.c, ug_intro.c)
   * Finally created this ChangeLog.
