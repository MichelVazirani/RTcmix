Saturday, Dec 5, 2001 John Gibson <johgibso@indiana.edu>

   * Support for MacOS X 10.1 (output only).
   * New function to see what's actually in a makegen array (fdump).
   * New Butterworth filter instrument (BUTTER).
   * New FM instrument (WIGGLE).
   * New gen 4 function - like setline, but lets you set curvature
     of each segment (derived from ucsd carl src).
   * Optional arguments to gen20 to set min and max.

Saturday, Aug 4, 2001 John Gibson <johgibso@indiana.edu>

   * Update to more recent version of sndlib, with lots
     of reorganization of sound file code.
   * Make it easier to fix a nagging problem that happens when
     an NFS server's clock doesn't match the client's clock.
     Various parts of RTcmix will complain if a file's modification
     date is more recent than the file's peak stats. Changing
     MAX_PEAK_STATS_AGE in H/sfheader.h can silence these complaints.


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.5, Sunday, Apr 15, 2001 ****

Thursday, Feb 15 2001 Doug Scott <netdscott@netscape.net>

   * More work on optimizing and cleaning up MOVE and PLACE.

Wednesday, Feb 14, 2001 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Added (optional) support for Python as an alternative to Minc.

Sunday, Feb 11, 2001 Doug Scott <netdscott@netscape.net>

   * Fixed bugs in real time PLACE and MOVE commands that were causing
     slowdowns.

Wednesday, Feb 7, 2001 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Changed srand() so that if you don't give it a seed argument, it uses
     the system microsecond counter to seed the random number generator.
     This way, you won't get the same random number sequence each time
     you run a score.
   * New makegen, gen1, for loading samples from a sound file into a
     function table.  (See syntax description in sys/gen1.c.)
   * Make the "--force" option tell sfcreate to impose a sound file header
     on a file that doesn't have a header.  Useful for raw sound files.

Saturday, Feb 3, 2001 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New reverb instrument, FREEVERB, derived from code by Jezar
     (http://www.dreampoint.co.uk/~jzracc/freeverb.htm)
   * Fix problem in Perl extension, which would cause a numerical
     scalar in Perl to be passed to RTcmix as a string pointer.


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.4 ****

Sunday, Dec 17, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Perl extension compilation fix.
   * More n_args decls cleanups in ./sys and inst dirs.
   * Fix bug in REVMIX that caused clicks for files with more than one channel.
   * Install new PLACE

Friday, Dec 08, 2000 Douglas Scott <netdscott@netscape.net>

   * Added TRANSBEND instrument which allows time-varying pitch changes.
   * Fixed bug in TRANS call to tableset().
   * Completely rewrote PLACE program to make it real-time.
   * Added RT MOVE to same directory (builds both MOVE and PLACE).
   * Added builtin utilities for generating random and weighted random vals.
   * Added setexp() command to generate exponential lines for amplitudes, etc.
   * Cleaned up n_args decls in ./sys.
   * Added a check for SR <= 0 to rtsetparams().


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.3 ****

Thursday, Sep 28, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Many small changes / fixes for real time performance

Saturday, September 9, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>
 
   * Fix bug: some conversion and info functions would act
     strange if they were to return -1.  (Cleaned up error
     condition in parse_dispatch.c.)

Monday, July 31, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Added (optional) support for Perl as an alternative to Minc.
   * CMIX -h (or PCMIX -h) give a usage statement.


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.2 ****

Friday, June 9, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fix to sample_scos_1.0/STRUM2.sco. Would bail out before.
   * For Irix, create LIBDESTDIR before making instruments. That's
     the default location for the so_locations file.
   * Fix to sockit.C accept call that could affect compilation in
     some Linux distributions.


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.1 ****

NOTE: If you're running 3.0.0 now, you *really* want this update, due
to the fix Dave describes just below. There have been no changes to
instruments, so you can still use the 3.0.0 ones.   -JG

Thursday, June 8, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fix to main.C supplied by Doug Scott -- affects compilation on
     Linux Mandrake (and probably other distros), as well as Irix 6.5.
   * Some other minor changes to encourage compilation on Irix 6.5.

Thursday, June 8, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Fixed Iptr deletion conditions in intraverse()
     memory overhead should be MUCH less now


**** Released RTcmix-3.0.0 ****

Saturday, May 27, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Added new instrument, REVMIX, by Ivica Bukvic, to insts.std.
   * Revive the sndreverse program.
   * Input from files now ignores in-bus count entirely.
   * New function table assigns for FMINST and WAVESHAPE (see
     docs/README.table_assigns). This makes old scores incompatible!
   * New sample scores showing bus_config feature.

Thursday, May 25, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New files: NEWS and docs/README.bus_config

Tuesday, May 16, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Many changes to ANSI-fy some older code and to enable more
     productive use of -Wall when compiling.
   * New message functions advise(), warn() and die() for use
     by instruments and others.
   * Add README.inst_porting and an instrument sample code dir.
   * Fix compilation problem involving pthreads that triggered
     errors on Irix 6.5 (and warnings on Irix 6.3).
     (main.C, intraverse.C)

Friday, May 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Get rid of MAXBUF -- no longer necessary or even useful.

Wednesday, May 10, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Changed bus_config schema to provide default behavior
     to maintain backwards compatibility with pre-bus_config scores

Sunday, May 7, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Update RT insts to 3.0 API (for bus_config, etc.).
   * Allocate input buffer dynamically in all RT insts that need one.
     (This is because MIPSPro compiler can't size an automatic array
     by a variable -- that's a GNU extension.) Allocate in run method
     to avoid gobbling up all memory when insts init before playing.

[Versions after 2.2.3 have new bus architecture, for instrument
 chaining and better use of multi-chan cards.]


**** Released RTcmix-2.2.3 ****

Thursday, May 4, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Reduce memory overhead of these instruments:
        COMBIT, DELAY, INPUTSIG, MIX, TRANS, STEREO, ELL, FILTSWEEP,
        FLANGE, TRANS and JDELAY.
     (Worth upgrading for this, since it was possible to exhaust
     virtual memory if a script had many, many notes -- all grabbing
     private buffers at the start, before playing.)
   * When reading off the end of a Minc array with get_array,
     return the last array element instead of zero.
     (minc_functions.c)

Monday, April 24, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * If set_option("audio_off") precedes call to rtsetparams,
     then audio output port not opened, and user can run multiple
     jobs (writing to disk).

Saturday, April 22, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New instrument: stgran (Mara Helmuth)
   * Add prototypes for sound.c and minout.c functions to ugens.h
   * Various cleanups in sound.c
   * Add minout.c (from various disk-based insts) to sys dir
     (and remove from gravy and sgran)

**** Released RTcmix-2.2.2 ****

Friday, April 21, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New instruments in insts.jg: COMPLIMIT and JGRAN

Thursday, April 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Changed the sample WAVETABLE scores to use new function
     table assignments.
   * Merged the INSTALL files into a top-level INSTALL file.
   * New PLACE instrument - just like disk-based place, but 
     using RT mechanism for faster file i/o.

Friday, March 31, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fixed bug in rtinput.c: sometimes got initial offset wrong in
     fairly obscure circumstances. (rtinput.c)
   * Added dBFS peak and location in seconds to peak stats report.
     (rtwritesamps.C)

Saturday, March 26, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Show peak stats, and close output file, even when killing with
     control-C. (main.C)
   * Added dbamp function for lib and Minc.
     (ampdb.c, minc_functions.c, ug_intro.c)
   * Finally created this ChangeLog.
