**** Released RTcmix-3.0.0 ****

Sunday, May 28, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New sample scores showing bus_config feature.
   * Some last-minute fixes for SGI compilation.

Saturday, May 27, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Added new instrument, REVMIX, by Ivica Bukvic, to insts.std.
   * Removed all the USE_SNDLIB ifdefs, since we always use it.
   * Input from files now ignores in-bus count entirely.
   * New function table assigns for FMINST and WAVESHAPE (see
     docs/README.table_assigns). This makes old scores incompatible!

Friday, May 26, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Revive the sndreverse program.

Thursday, May 25, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New files: NEWS and docs/README.bus_config
   * Bumped version number (version.h) to 3.0.0.

Tuesday, May 16, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Fix compilation problem involving pthreads that triggered
     errors on Irix 6.5 (and warnings on Irix 6.3).
     (main.C, intraverse.C)
   * Many changes to ANSI-fy some older code and to enable more
     productive use of -Wall when compiling.
   * New message functions advise(), warn() and die() for use
     by instruments and others.
   * Add README.inst_porting and an instrument sample code dir.

Friday, May 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Get rid of MAXBUF -- no longer necessary or even useful.

Wednesday, May 10, 2000 Dave Topper <topper@virginia.edu>

   * Changed bus_config schema to provide default behavior
     to maintain backwards compatibility with pre-bus_config scores

Sunday, May 7, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Update some RT insts to 2.3 API.
   * Allocate input buffer dynamically in all RT insts that need one.
     (This is because MIPSPro compiler can't size an automatic array
     by a variable -- that's a GNU extension.) Allocate in run method
     to avoid gobbling up all memory when insts init before playing.

Thursday, May 4, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Reduce memory overhead of TRANS. (TRANS.C)
   * When reading off the end of a Minc array with get_array,
     return the last array element instead of zero.
     (minc_functions.c)

Saturday, April 22, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Add prototypes for sound.c and minout.c functions to ugens.h
   * Various cleanups in sound.c
   * Add minout.c (from various disk-based insts) to sys dir
     (and remove from gravy and sgran)

Friday, April 21, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * New instruments in insts.jg: COMPLIMIT and JGRAN

Thursday, April 12, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Changed the sample WAVETABLE scores to use new function
     table assignments.
   * Merged the INSTALL files into a top-level INSTALL file.
   * New PLACE instrument - just like disk-based place, but 
     using RT mechanism for faster file i/o.
   * Added dBFS peak and location in seconds to peak stats report.
     (rtsendsamps.c)

Saturday March 26, 2000 John Gibson <johngibson@virginia.edu>

   * Show peak stats, and close output file, even when killing with
     control-C. (main.C)
   * Added dbamp function for lib and Minc.
   * Bumped version number (version.h) to 2.3.1.
   * Finally created this ChangeLog.
