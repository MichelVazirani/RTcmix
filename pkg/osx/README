To build a package, first make distclean your source tree.
Then uncomment the redefinition of LIBDESTDIR in site.conf
that sets this to /Applications/rtcmix/shlib.  Make this
directory as root.

Now rebuild RTcmix.
Install as root.  This will put the dso's in the new LIBDESTDIR.

Finally, in the pkg/osx dir, type "make".  That will put
an installable package on your Desktop.

Before testing, delete /Applications/rtcmix.

(To streamline this process, we need to avoid hardcoding the
shared lib dir that's used in the load command.  Many places
in RTcmix use SHAREDLIBDIR, which comes from LIBDESTDIR.)
