Welcome to the RTcmix Installer. You will be guided through the steps necessary
to install this software.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
To make RTcmix work, you must include the path to its executable programs in
your shell path. To do this in bash (the default shell for new OS X
installations), edit the &ldquo;.profile&rdquo; text file &mdash; note the dot
at the beginning of the name &mdash; in your home directory. Add these lines:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
PATH="/usr/local/rtcmix/bin:$PATH"\
export PATH\
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Use TextWrangler or some other plain text editor. If you use Apple&rsquo;s
TextEdit program, first make sure to choose the <b>Format &gt; Make Plain
Text</b> command before saving the file.
