I.  INSTALLATION
----------------

1)  Set up your linux audio driver either compile the kernel with sound, 
or get the OSS drivers:

	http://www.4front-tech.com

2)  Get the pthread libraries:

	http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/

Installation is simple.

Ia.  FOR THE CORE
-----------------

1)  Make directories called /musr and /musr/lib on your system
2)  Get the file RTcmix2.0.Linux.tgz
3)  untar RTcmix2.0.linux.tar.gz into /musr
4)  create a link from RTcmix2.0.linux to cmix (to avoid version confusion):
	ln -s /musr/RTcmix2.0.linux /musr/cmix
5)  cd into /musr/cmix
6)  do a make; make install
7)  Put /musr/cmix/bin into your $PATH

NOTE TO REDHAT USERS:  you may not have the lex libraries, in which case 
you'll get an error about -ll not found.  Change the Makefile in the Minc
directory to use -lfl (flex libraries) instead.

Ib.  FOR SEPARATE PACKAGES
--------------------------

1)  cd into /musr/cmix
2)  untar PACKAGE.tgz
3)  cd into /musr/cmix/PACKAGE
4)  do a make; make install

NOTE:  many packages will not install into /musr/cmix/bin because they are 
development work.  You'll have to CD into the specific directory and run 
the ./program from there.

The following instruments are included in the base distribution:

mix/MIX
wavetable/WAVETABLE

If you want more, you should download insts.tgz and compile them.

and so on...

II.  RUN THEM SCOREFILES!
-------------------------

1)  Get or create two soundfiles (eg., /snd/test.snd (mono) and /snd/test2.snd
(stereo))

They must be NeXT/IRCAM style which means they can be either Next or IRCAM 
style with the hybrid header.  You can put that header on with sfcreate or 
one of the I* scripts.

The SOX package is very useful for creating such files.  The following two lines will get 'em just right (for a mono, 44k file):

sox $input.aiff -x -t .sf $name.snd # note the -x swaps bytes
sfcreate -c 1 -r 44100 -i name.snd

2) Start running stuff in ./cmix/insts/SAMPLE_SCORES

EG.,

	CMIX < mix1.sco  

III. HAVE FUN!
