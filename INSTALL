Here is how to install RTcmix and its instrument packages.

1. Download RTcmix-[version].tar.gz and unpack it anywhere you like (in your
   home directory, or in /usr/local/src, for example) by typing

      tar xfz RTcmix-[version].tar.gz
      (or: gunzip -c RTcmix-[version].tar.gz | tar xf - )

2. If you downloaded the "cadillac version," which contains the optional
   instrument packages, skip this step.

   Download at least the std and jg packages, and unpack them into the
   "insts" directory of your RTcmix.

3. cd into the top level of the RTcmix directory, and run the configure script:

      ./configure

   There are some options you might want to give this script.  Here's a
   description of them.  If you already ran configure without the options,
   it's okay to run it again with the options you want.
 
      --with-alsa       Use the ALSA driver on Linux
      --with-perl       Build the Perl-enabled RTcmix (PCMIX)
      --with-python     Build the Python-enabled RTcmix (PYCMIX)
      --with-netplay    Enable code that lets you play RTcmix over a network

   If you have more than one version of Perl or Python on your system, you
   can tell RTcmix which one to use by giving its path with the option, e.g.:

      --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python

   Give these options in any order, following the configure script name:

      ./configure --with-alsa --with-perl --with-python

   NOTE: If you're running a Mac OS X earlier than 10.3 and want to enable
   Python, see the instructions below.

4. There are some special settings that you can make in the "site.conf" file,
   though most people will never need to do this.

5. Make the package.  Be sure you're still in the top RTcmix directory and type:

      make

6. If the package builds without errors, install it:

      make install

7. Add the bin directory inside of the RTcmix directory to your $PATH.  For
   example, if you're using the bash shell, put something like this in .profile:

      PATH="/path/to/rtcmix/bin:$PATH"
      export PATH

8. Try running some of the scores in docs/sample_scores.  To run any score,
   type "CMIX < scorefile.sco".  If these seem to work, your installation
   is probably ok.

See the README files in the docs dir for information on recent features.

For some help getting started, check out the RTcmix web pages at Columbia
University, which have lots of documentation and tutorials:

Platform Notes


Linux
-----


Mac OS X
--------

   - You must use OS X 10.1 or later, and you must have installed the
     appropriate version of the Developer Tools.

   - If you want to use gnuplot with the fplot and plottable script functions,
     you have to install both the command-line gnuplot from source and the
     Aquaterm program.  See http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net for instructions.

   - If you want to enable the Python front end, and you are running a version
     of Mac OS X earlier than 10.3, you will have to build Python from source,
     because the Python supplied with the Developer Tools CD is incomplete.
     See the instructions in RTcmix/src/parser/python/NOTES.


SGI Irix
--------

   - It's been a long time since any of us have compiled RTcmix on Irix, so
     who knows whether it will work or even build.  Let us know what you find.
