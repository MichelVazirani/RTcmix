Here is how to install RTcmix and its instrument packages.

1. Download RTcmix-[version].tar.gz and unpack it anywhere you like (in your
   home directory, or in /usr/local/src, for example) by typing

      tar xfz RTcmix-[version].tar.gz
      (or: gunzip -c RTcmix-[version].tar.gz | tar xf - )

2. If you downloaded the "cadillac version," which contains the optional
   instrument packages, skip this step.

   a. Download at least the std and jg packages, and unpack them into the
      "insts" directory of your RTcmix.

   b. The package directory will have a version number, like "std-4.0.0".  It's
      a good idea to rename this to remove the version number (e.g., "std").

3. cd into the top level of the RTcmix directory, and run the configure script:

      ./configure

   There are some options you might want to give this script.  Here's a
   description of them.  If you already ran configure without the options,
   it's okay to run it again with the options you want.
 
      --with-alsa       Use the ALSA driver on Linux
      --with-perl       Build the Perl-enabled RTcmix (PCMIX)
      --with-python     Build the Python-enabled RTcmix (PYCMIX)
      --with-netplay    Enable code that lets you play RTcmix over a network

   If you have more than one version of perl or python on your system, you
   can tell RTcmix which one to use by giving its path with the option, e.g.:

      --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python

   Give these options in any order, following the configure script name:

      ./configure --with-alsa --with-perl --with-python

4. There are some special settings that you can make in the "site.conf" file,
   though most people will never need to do this.

5. Make the package.  Be sure you're still in the top RTcmix directory and type:

      make

6. If the package builds without errors, install it:

      make install

7. Add the bin directory inside of the RTcmix directory to your $PATH.  For
   example, if you're using the bash shell, put this in .bashrc:

      PATH="/path/to/rtcmix:$PATH"

8. Try running some of the scores in docs/sample_scores.  To run any score,
   type "CMIX < scorefile.sco".  If these seem to work, your installation
   is probably ok.

See the README files in the docs dir for information on recent features.

University, which have lots of documentation and tutorials:

Platform Notes


Linux
-----


Mac OS X
--------

   - You must use OS X 10.1 or later, and you must have installed the
     appropriate version of the Developer Tools.

   - If you want to use gnuplot with the fplot Minc function, you have
     to install both the command-line gnuplot from source and Aquaterm.
     See http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net for instructions.

   - If you want to enable the Python front-end, you may have to build
     Python from source, because the Python supplied with the Developer
     Tools CD is incomplete.  See the instructions in RTcmix/Python/NOTES.


SGI Irix
--------

   - It's been a long time since any of us have compiled RTcmix on Irix, so
     who knows whether it will work or even build.  Let us know what you find.
