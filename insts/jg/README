This package of instruments are written and maintained by John Gibson
<johgibso at indiana dot edu>.

Many of them are original; some are based on code or ideas by others;
a few are reworkings of instruments by others.  Some require objlib
(in this directory), which is a C++ unit generator library based on
Perry Cook's STK, the Objective C library in NeXT-era cmix, and some
code from csound and clm.


BUTTER    - Butterworth filter with low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and
            band-reject types, and time-varying cutoff (or center) frequency
            and bandwidth.

COMPLIMIT - a compressor / limiter with adjustable lookahead, envelope
            times, threshold and compression ratio

DECIMATE  - Sample bit-depth reducer, for nasty noisy effects.

DISTORT   - Distortion (very primitive at the moment)

ELL       - an old cmix favorite, dusted off and RT-ified ... cascaded
            IIR filters with built-in elliptical design program.

EQ        - Equalizer with peak/notch, shelving and high/low pass types,
            and time-varying frequency, Q and filter gain.

FILTSWEEP - two-pole filter with time-varying center freq. and bandwidth

FLANGE    - a flanger with choice of IIR comb or FIR notch filter. Serves
            as a demonstration of some of the unit gen objects.

FOLLOWER  - three envelope-following instruments, which use the amp envelope
            of an input to:
               1. control the amp envelope of another sound,
               2. control a Butterworth filter applied to another sound, or
               3. to gate another sound.

FREEVERB  - a version of the Freeverb reverberator written by "Jezar"
            (http://www.dreampoint.co.uk/~jzracc/freeverb.htm).  I added
            pre-delay and adapted it to RTcmix.  This is a high quality
            Schroeder reverb, since it has 8 combs and 4 allpass filters
            for each output channel, and it's tuned well.  This uses about
            60-70% of the CPU time that REVERBIT does, for some reason.

JCHOR     - a variation on Lansky's chor program, which sprays a slice of
            an input file around the stereo field. Some limitations have
            been removed, and you can transpose the grain.

JDELAY    - a tweak of the standard RTcmix DELAY program, adding a low-pass
            filter and dc-blocker (useful for short resonating delay times),
            among other things.

JFIR      - an FIR filter with frequency response sampling. Use a makegen
            to "draw" a frequency response for the filter.

JGRAN     - a granular synthesis instrument derived from a Cecilia module
            by Mathieu Bezkorowajny and Jean Piche. Produces grains by
            wavetable or FM synthesis.

MOOGVCF   - Resonant low-pass filter with time-varying frequency and resonance,
            based on work by Stilson, Smith and Kellett.

MROOM     - RTcmix version of the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's
            moving-source room simulation program.  You're better off with
            MOVE (in insts.std/MOVE).

PAN       - simple mixing instrument that follows a pan curve

REV       - some Schroeder reverbs that are part of the STK package.

REVERBIT  - RTcmix version of Lansky's reverberator. Added low-pass filter
            and removed a few limitations.  Effective for a moderate amount
            of roominess.  (See also PLACE in insts.std/MOVE.)

ROOM      - RTcmix version of Lansky's (and Garton's, I think) old room
            simulation.  A classic!

SHAPE     - waveshaping instrument that differs from insts.std/WAVESHAPE in
            that it can accept input from a bus and offers a different way
            of performing amplitude normalization.

SPECTACLE - a family of spectral processing instruments.  SPECTEQ offers
            FFT-based equalization; SPECTACLE and TVSPECTACLE create specral
            delay effects, in which each FFT bin has its own recirculating
            delay line.

SROOM     - RTcmix version of the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's
            stationary-source room simulation program.  You're better off
            with PLACE (in insts.std/MOVE).

VOCODE    - a channel vocoder. Control a bank of band-pass filters from
            a real-time analysis of another file.

VOCODE2   - another channel vocoder, which allows input of both carrier and
            modulator from buses.

VOCODESYNTH - yet another channel vocoder, which synthesizes its output rather
            than applying time-varying filters to a carrier signal.

WIGGLE    - simple FM synthesis with a separate glissando function.  Cooler
            than that description makes it sound...


The following are disk-based instruments that operate in the old cmix way.
(with files opened by input and output instead of rtinput and rtoutput).
The only one worth bothering with is denoise.

bender    - a variation on Lansky's vreadin program, which lets you bend
            the pitch of an input file along a glissando curve. Uses Doug
            Scott's trans interpolation. (NOTE: superceded by Doug's new
            TRANSBEND in insts.std.)

denoise   - a translation of Mark Dolson's old CARL program, which does
            frequency-domain noise reduction. Pretty effective for cleaning
            up files with a moderate amount of constant background noise.

splice    - a simple program that makes it easy to stitch together final
            mixes for a CD without getting any clicks at the splice points.

transpan  - revision of Doug Scott's trans program to allow static panning of
            a mono input file (NOTE: superceded by revised TRANS in insts.std)
