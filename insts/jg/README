Most of these are reworkings of older cmix instruments by other people.
A few require objlib (in this directory), which is a C++ unit generator
library based on Perry Cook's STK, the Objective C library in NeXT-era
cmix, and some code from csound and clm.

(Note for SGI users: These will require a little futzing to get them
running under the current version of RTcmix for Irix. The Linux version
now has reset and setline in the core, and also has a different Makefile
scheme. Also, the VOCODE instrument uses a sound file input object that
relies on sndlib, which hasn't been brought into the SGI version.)


VOCODE   - a channel vocoder. Control a bank of band-pass filters from
           a real-time analysis of another file. (Linux-only, because
           of method used to open two rt input files.)

JFIR     - an FIR filter with frequency response sampling. Use a makegen
           to "draw" a frequency response for the filter. (I can get up
           to 600 taps in real-time on a PII266.)

FLANGE   - a flanger with choice of IIR comb or FIR notch filter. Serves
           as a demonstration of some of the unit gen objects.

JCHOR    - a variation on Lansky's chor program, which sprays a slice of
           an input file around the stereo field. Some limitations have
           been removed, and you can transpose the grain.

ELL      - an old cmix favorite, dusted off and RT-ified ... cascaded
           IIR filters with built-in elliptical design program.
           ***NOTE: Requires libf2c.a and f2c.h (both might be installed
           with g77, the GNU Fortran-77 compiler).

JDELAY   - a tweak of the standard RTcmix DELAY program, adding a low-pass
           filter and dc-blocker, among other things. Useful for short
           resonating delay times.

REVERBIT - a translation of Lansky's fast reverberator. Added low-pass filter
           and removed a few limitations. Very effective for a moderate
           amount of roominess. (This'll be great for the future shared
           audio buffer RTcmix.)

SROOM    - the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's stationary-source room
           simulation program. Not nearly as effective as place, but kind
           of a kick to see running in real time.

MROOM    - the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's moving-source room
           simulation program. Not a replacement for move, but fun to run
           in real time.

ROOM     - Lansky's (and Garton's, I think) old room simulation.

REV      - some Schroeder reverbs that are part of the STK package.

PAN      - simple mixing instrument that follows a pan curve

bender   - a variation on Lansky's vreadin program, which lets you bend
           the pitch of an input file along a glissando curve. Uses Doug
           Scott's trans interpolation.

denoise  - a translation of Mark Dolson's old CARL program, which does
           frequency-domain noise reduction. Pretty effective for cleaning
           up files with a moderate amount of constant background noise.

splice   - a simple program that makes it easy to stitch together final
           mixes for a CD without getting any clicks at the splice points.
