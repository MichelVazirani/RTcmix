Most of these are reworkings of older cmix instruments by other people.
A few require objlib (in this directory), which is a C++ unit generator
library based on Perry Cook's STK, the Objective C library in NeXT-era
cmix, and some code from csound and clm.

(Note for SGI users: These instruments probably only work on the version
of RTCmix with combined Linux and SGI support.)


VOCODE    - a channel vocoder. Control a bank of band-pass filters from
            a real-time analysis of another file.

JFIR      - an FIR filter with frequency response sampling. Use a makegen
            to "draw" a frequency response for the filter. (I can get up
            to 600 taps in real-time on a PII266.)

FLANGE    - a flanger with choice of IIR comb or FIR notch filter. Serves
            as a demonstration of some of the unit gen objects.

COMPLIMIT - a compressor / limiter with adjustable lookahead, envelope
            times, threshold and compression ratio

JGRAN     - a granular synthesis instrument derived from a Cecilia module
            by Mathieu Bezkorowajny and Jean Piche. Produces grains by
            wavetable or FM synthesis.

JCHOR     - a variation on Lansky's chor program, which sprays a slice of
            an input file around the stereo field. Some limitations have
            been removed, and you can transpose the grain.

ELL       - an old cmix favorite, dusted off and RT-ified ... cascaded
            IIR filters with built-in elliptical design program.
            ***NEWSFLASH: No longer requires libf2c.a and f2c.h, thanks
            to Alistair Riddell and Ross Bencina.

FILTSWEEP - two-pole filter with time-varying center freq. and bandwidth

JDELAY    - a tweak of the standard RTcmix DELAY program, adding a low-pass
            filter and dc-blocker, among other things. Useful for short
            resonating delay times.

REVERBIT  - a translation of Lansky's fast reverberator. Added low-pass filter
            and removed a few limitations. Very effective for a moderate
            amount of roominess.

SROOM     - the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's stationary-source room
            simulation program. Not nearly as effective as place, but kind
            of a kick to see running in real time.

MROOM     - the old cmix implementation of F.R. Moore's moving-source room
            simulation program. Not a replacement for move, but fun to run
            in real time.

ROOM      - Lansky's (and Garton's, I think) old room simulation.

REV       - some Schroeder reverbs that are part of the STK package.

PAN       - simple mixing instrument that follows a pan curve

bender    - a variation on Lansky's vreadin program, which lets you bend
            the pitch of an input file along a glissando curve. Uses Doug
            Scott's trans interpolation.

denoise   - a translation of Mark Dolson's old CARL program, which does
            frequency-domain noise reduction. Pretty effective for cleaning
            up files with a moderate amount of constant background noise.

splice    - a simple program that makes it easy to stitch together final
            mixes for a CD without getting any clicks at the splice points.

transpan  - revision of Doug Scott's trans program to allow static panning of
            a mono input file (NOTE: superceded by revised TRANS in insts.std)
